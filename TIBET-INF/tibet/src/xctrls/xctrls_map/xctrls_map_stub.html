Document containing proper code constructs to be loaded by TIBET and have
things like the map source code, etc. dynamically driven. It also calls back
into TIBET via the frame element (this file expects to be loaded into the
iframe created for it by the 'xctrls:map' control), so that a reliable
mechanism is provided for map setup.
